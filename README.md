I'm a programmer and tech enthusiast.

I work at HP Inc.  Along with Data Warehousing, and ETL, I also develop the tooling for our data pipelines.

My strategy is to adapt, wherever possible, existing tools, and develop from scratch only when necessary.

The open-source tooling around Software Engineering is amazing, and Data Engineers need to catch up.
Do we even have CI/CD for Data Engineering?
Scaling data solutions is still an extremely difficult proposition.
Data Warehouses and Data Lakes are big monoliths that should, and can most probably be split up as per their domains, microservices style.

I believe we have a huge opportunity in Data Engineering to automate away much of the plumbing, and define new paradigms, to get data where it needs to be, faster.

I'm still building this site and will add to it over time.
